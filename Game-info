Copy the folder and download a python interpreter on your device to run the game
if any error please tell this to me and you may can help me to improve this game 
as this is my first game which I have published and I am a unexperianced programmer of 12 years of age
I start coding 4 years ago and here is my journey
I know:-
Python(Learnt)
C#(Still learning for unity)
Java(Still learning)
but you know learning never ends!!
